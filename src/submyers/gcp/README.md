### Sentiment 

#### Outline

We looked to sentiment as an initial sentence measurement to expand on the data supplied by Kaggle. Generating the data and evaluating the resulting values entails the following steps, which later sections will cover in greater detail:

1. Retrieve Data, Install Vader
2. Format Data
3. Calculate Sentiment
4. Predict Toxicity

##### 1 - Retrive Data, Install Vader

If you have not already, get the train.csv and test.csv files for the Kaggle competition "Jigsaw Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification" (https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-unintended-bias-in-toxicity-classification/data). Once you have the files, install the Vader python package with the following command:

```
$ pip3 install vaderSentiment
```

##### 2 - Format Data

##### 3 - Calculate Sentiment

##### 4 - Predict Toxicity
