# GCP Actions
###

## Synopsis ##

This document contains a list of actions I performed on the GSP to get things to work.
All of the actions listed are not critical, but I took notes so I we need to start all
again, we know how to format things.

Also, I used the gsutil ofthen to work with GSP ssh command line to copy over the train
and test CSV files to access the data, commands like:

  $ gsutil cp gs://jbmfinal/train.csv ./ 

to copy over the train.csv data set from user interface based GSP storage area.

Please note that I often had to use python3 and pip3 to get things operational.
